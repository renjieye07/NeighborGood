NeighborGood
NeighborGood is a two-semester long senior project in SE195A/B at San José State University in Spring 2019.
What is NeighborGood?
NeighborGood is a web application that focuses on providing convenient communication for users and improving relationships between people living in the same neighborhoods. Neighbourly relations have decreased in the United States since the 1950s which has resulted in a lack of communication between neighbors. Additionally, only 20% of Americans spend their time with the people living next door. As a team, we are aware of the social issue and decided to create a platform and provide an opportunity for our users to actively interact with each other online.
